### Floodgate
#### Makes your Minecraft swimming pool easier than ever!

This mod adds a block that can fill arbitrary and dynamic volumes with fluid source blocks. In other words, it can fill a hole as you dig it.

The floodgate can be used with EnderIO fluid conduits and IC2's fluid pump to move fluids from one body to another.

Several mods add pumps that can suck up fluid source blocks (like IC2), but BuildCraft is the only mod I've found that can place them back into the world. This mod is intended to replace the floodgate functionality from BuildCraft, which did not have a 1.10.2 release.

This mod depends on EnderCore 0.4.1.66-beta (or above), since it's intended to work with EnderIO's fluid conduits.
